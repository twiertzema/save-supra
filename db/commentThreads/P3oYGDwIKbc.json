I leveled up everything from strength to health to magic to double-jumps and mid-air dashing, and those things helped me SO much that I actually managed to beat the game, unlike Isaac where I lost to Mom once and that angered me enough not to play since.\n\nBut yes, Rogue Legacy is a great game and has a TON of replayability with NewGame+, NewGame++, and so on, each one significantly harder than the last.
