The concept of \"The Room\", and relying on things like the peephole, the tunnel, the phone, the window, and the door's looking glass to effectively force you to operate in isolation was an inspired brushstroke to address the protagonists repressed voyeuristic impulses.

The expansion/clarification of the setting mechanics was good to have, and I won't say it didn't have it's moments (I thought our moments with Vincent were particularly well done by the standards of any of the games), but the ramp up in difficulty/pressure not to use guns despite melee becoming worthless bothered me deeply. I truly loath the introductions of running or \"hiding\" by flicking off the light on a mandatory basis. The idea of being bad at combat to drive home the feeling of helplessness is noble, but die and reload enough times, it DETRACTS from fear factor, and the constant stress (which is not the same as fear) was not enjoyable. Exacerabting this was the fact that WAY too much of the game was running through \"dungeons\" for basically no reason. From the mall to the sewer to that building UGH.

That said, I enjoyed the expansion of the story with Lisa and the other SH1 cast members, and Travis's personal narrative brought a lot to the table... The idea of mirrors was both symbolically inspired as well as a great mechanics feature an a brutal poke at Travis's subconscious fear that he inherited the same traits that drove his parents to maddness and suicide.
