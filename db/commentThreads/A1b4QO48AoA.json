In terms of visuals, you really have to play it to appreciate the art style and the astounding amount of details each room provides. The music is my favorite of the year. Both the visuals and music help craft a unique and memorable atmosphere for each area. The gameplay starts slow, but gets better and better as you gain more powers and freedom of control. The enemies variety is astounding and the boss battles are challenging, fun and satisfying. The map is huge and the feeling I would get when discovring new, complete areas behind seemingly small access points would often blow my mind, something only Dark Souls provided me before. It really feels like the developers created a deep, heavy lore with this insect world and this is what made me lose myself in it. From the lone surface village of Dirtmouth to the beautiful Greenpath, to the disturbingly dark Deepnest, to the otherwordly Kingdom Edge... truly, Hollow Knight is a game dense with amazing content (I clocked at 26 hours before DLC). Metroidvanias are one of my favorite genres, and Dark Souls is one of my favorite games. Hollow Knight is a mix of both.
