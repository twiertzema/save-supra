Link's Awakening has always been my favorite 2D Zelda and I'm glad to say that this is a very solid remake with only a few flaws. The biggest improvement has to be the better inventory system, thanks to many items being automatically equipped once you find them. In the original version, each item must be mapped to one of the two face buttons and you have to switch them all the time. That right there is enough for me to call it a satisfying remake. Apart from that, the visuals are charming, the remade soundtrack is much better than I first anticipated and I love the fact that there are no longer segmented screens on the overworld. The biggest flaw is well known, which is the unexplainably poor performance on the Switch. There really is no excuse, not when you have a game like Zelda BOTW running flawlessly. I also still feel like the remake doesn't truly capture the original's mysterious/darker atmosphere that made it so memorable. At least the Face Shrine was still the highlight in terms of atmosphere. Overall an excellent remake.", "textOriginal": "I finally have enough energy to be out of bed, I had a terrible flu the past week.
