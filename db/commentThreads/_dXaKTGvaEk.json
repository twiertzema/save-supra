The claustrophobic environments, ghosts that can pop out anywhere and anytime, having to go into first person camera to hurt the ghosts, all mixed with an extremely unsettling sound design. The gameplay is very fun as well. I love how the various ghosts (some of them recurring) have backstories: Broken Neck Woman, Fallen Woman, Woman in Box, Sunken Woman, Rope Man, etc.... very memorable. They all have their own \"battle theme\" as well, just listen to the tracks from the ghosts I just mentioned, all very unsettling.
