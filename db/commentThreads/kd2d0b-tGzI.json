Without spoiling too much, this game hides something behind its bright first impression. It has an awesome cast of characters and the hero can use his empathy to transform into various forms of enemies he fought, each with their level and skills, which gives you a lot of possibilities to create a unique team tailored to your preferences. It also features the best Steal system I've seen: let's say you face someone holding a knife, you can steal his weapon at a set % chance and if you succeed, his sprite will change and he'll be looking sad without his knife (and attack power). This is an awesome game with a great soundtrack and plenty of side quests that should not be missed (one of them I still think about). Last thing, I played this game onEasy difficulty which probably cut about 10-20 hours of grinding as it doubles Experience.
