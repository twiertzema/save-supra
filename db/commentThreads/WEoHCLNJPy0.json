The moment I finally get the whole time travel fuckery (pardon my french), I saw the story in a new light and loved it all the more. And if I could, I'd also have removed the whole \"Greenpeace\" aspect of the game. The preachy, moralizing Dwarves part and the \"Give us back our planet\" bit in the end game dungeon (was it Dinopolis or Terra Tower?). I mean, it didn't make sense since the world was pretty clean and nature untouched, or, if you want to add that message they should have made the setting more steam-punky (but just to make sense, mind you). The problem I have with the \"Earth\" is that her motivation for.....doing her thing (againg, massive spoilers, so not saying anything) is that it was more Tree-loving than existential nightmare. And I think it was a wasted opportunity, since it's a plot thread that is blurted by Lucca if you have her fighting Lavos' second form, so you can't say it's not canon. \u00a0", "textOriginal": "@daniel cardoso\u00a0I wholeheratedly agree with the campfire part. Cross was born in that scene, so it's normal some fans think of Cross as a fanfic of Trigger. Cross is polarizing but, the way I found the experience to be most enjoyable is to think of it as a \"Serge\" story. Don't bother with any other characters and just focus on Serge. The moment I finally get the whole time travel fuckery (pardon my french), I saw the story in a new light and loved it all the more. And if I could, I'd also have removed the whole \"Greenpeace\" aspect of the game. The preachy, moralizing Dwarves part and the \"Give us back our planet\" bit in the end game dungeon (was it Dinopolis or Terra Tower?). I mean, it didn't make sense since the world was pretty clean and nature untouched, or, if you want to add that message they should have made the setting more steam-punky (but just to make sense, mind you). The problem I have with the \"Earth\" is that her motivation for.....doing her thing (againg, massive spoilers, so not saying anything) is that it was more Tree-loving than existential nightmare. And I think it was a wasted opportunity, since it's a plot thread that is blurted by Lucca if you have her fighting Lavos' second form, so you can't say it's not canon. \u00a0", "parentId": "Ugj_EWigpvIpvHgCoAEC", "authorDisplayName": "Hth", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJzUdBjq6KNX7cGSxsCAdQ9oDa3dbja2WK6uO16SgQ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UClQGoGm-rxJB0GD2KKW9f6Q", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UClQGoGm-rxJB0GD2KKW9f6Q"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2013-12-13T20:06:48Z", "updatedAt": "2013-12-13T20:06:48Z"}}, {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "aXi6p24sMD-tzl-J6s6DuYJVBik", "id": "Ugj_EWigpvIpvHgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-I_EN7-TPNNZJF9f", "snippet": {"textDisplay": "@sammanzhi\u00a0Thank you very much.\u00a0", "textOriginal": "@sammanzhi\u00a0Thank you very much.\u00a0", "parentId": "Ugj_EWigpvIpvHgCoAEC", "authorDisplayName": "Hth", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJzUdBjq6KNX7cGSxsCAdQ9oDa3dbja2WK6uO16SgQ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UClQGoGm-rxJB0GD2KKW9f6Q", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UClQGoGm-rxJB0GD2KKW9f6Q"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2013-12-13T19:58:07Z", "updatedAt": "2013-12-13T19:58:07Z"}}, {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "gAWX1ql00qFnjtcKVTrK84lPoek", "id": "Ugj_EWigpvIpvHgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-I_EN7-Sw2s2tp0o", "snippet": {"textDisplay": "@andrey22\u00a0I'd agree with that play order.", "textOriginal": "@andrey22\u00a0I'd agree with that play order.", "parentId": "Ugj_EWigpvIpvHgCoAEC", "authorDisplayName": "Turpenstein", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJzw7qJTCDY8prpYGg48s4txkRM8N4PLB4CGh9_2=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEW7DIJ9ZwrI-MtqQupVZUQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCEW7DIJ9ZwrI-MtqQupVZUQ"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2013-12-13T15:33:11Z", "updatedAt": "2013-12-13T15:33:11Z"}}, {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "DTl6VJNM6cwM7_FfIO08A7W9_tk", "id": "Ugj_EWigpvIpvHgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-I_EN7-SJwX3FEuB", "snippet": {"textDisplay": "@andrey22\u00a0does it even metter if its canon or not?\ncross is a good rpg regardless but i'm sure a lot of the fans of trigger did not like the direction cross took,especialy becuse of that scene with the fire.\nAlso it happens in a paralel universe so even for those who consider it canon to trigger it kinda of a paralel story and not directly related.", "textOriginal": "@andrey22\u00a0does it even metter if its canon or not?\ncross is a good rpg regardless but i'm sure a lot of the fans of trigger did not like the direction cross took,especialy becuse of that scene with the fire.\nAlso it happens in a paralel universe so even for those who consider it canon to trigger it kinda of a paralel story and not directly related.", "parentId": "Ugj_EWigpvIpvHgCoAEC", "authorDisplayName": "Daniel Cardoso", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJwUB0wYPYTFXos2_tjzqGnHAHpfpVOvZCHsGg=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvFj01sEgnwHaZxHSgR6ztw", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCvFj01sEgnwHaZxHSgR6ztw"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2013-12-13T09:51:23Z", "updatedAt": "2013-12-13T09:51:23Z"}}, {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "ozM60rjZjvARnOLqHEYMFeXGRUQ", "id": "Ugj_EWigpvIpvHgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-I_EN7-S4hJ_H4A_", "snippet": {"textDisplay": "@sammanzhi\u00a0It was tied off and then dropped off a bridge.
