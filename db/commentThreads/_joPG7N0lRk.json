Recently they changed Isaac's design from Castlevania: Curse of Darkness in the new season planned for the Netflix Castlevania series:\n\nOriginal: https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/castlevania/images/9/99/Isaac.png/revision/latest?cb=20170929204539&path-prefix=pt-br\n\nNetflix's ver: https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/villains/images/d/da/Isaac_animation_2.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20181009223250\n\n As you can compare, the rich aesthetic value the original design had is totally lost, apparently just to ensure the leftist demand for diversity is reached. They prefere statements over art quality (as you can see the redesign is just plain bad or simpler than the original) in a lot of situations, that can show a real tendency. But it's just an idea I've observed, so take it with a grain of salt.", "parentId": "Ugje9ABEsfUDi3gCoAEC", "authorDisplayName": "iuri Lua", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJzGoLx-_PCZ-lZ4YiuwvJrP7Oa0BQ20tYUn25gnTQ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTSZ99Pbq9uaCvI5NsZhnGQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCTSZ99Pbq9uaCvI5NsZhnGQ"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2018-10-26T21:29:38Z", "updatedAt": "2018-10-26T21:44:29Z"}}, {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "mndcRpWKG1k_GKBbVSP2ABQ5CyM", "id": "Ugje9ABEsfUDi3gCoAEC.7-H0Z7-6cd28mar5-uJXFa", "snippet": {"textDisplay": "I have the book, it's called _Mastering Manga with Mark Crilley_ (the author also made Akiko).
