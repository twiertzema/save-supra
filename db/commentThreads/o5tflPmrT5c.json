I had very high expectations when I heard it was largely inspired by Chrono Trigger, but the result unfortunately feels quite amateurish, even when considered as an Indie game. And this is the problem with I am Setsuna: instead of feeling like an RPG taking inspiration from classics like CT and Final Fantasy, it feels like it simply steals ideas and rides on them without adding any flavor.

The graphics are very pleasant to the eyes, but I feel like the simplistic 3D models did a disservice to the rest of the great artwork. The battle system quickly becomes boring because of a general lack of challenge and required strategies. But the story is by far the worst part of the game and may actually be one of the weakest I've seen in an RPG. To me, they failed to tell a very simple story on most fronts and I often found myself rolling my eyes at the characters' logic and at the plot \"twists\" that I saw coming from miles away. After I finished playing the game, I never considered adding it to my Top 10 of the year, but after thinking back on it, its unique setting stuck with me and I can only respect the developer for doing that. That is, going with an RPG that only takes place in a snowy world featuring a soundtrack that (almost) only uses the piano. What felt repetitive actually ended up making the game much more memorable than if both these elements had went with a more traditional style, which would have made the game completely forgettable.
