The sky-setting and the 50s theme had potential, but I feel like they just tacked it on and never really let you experience everything truly.\n\nWhen it comes to characters, the Luteces were probably the only ones I really enjoyed and Songbird was alright. After that I never liked any of the other ones, including Elizabeth.\n\nThe actual gameplay was probably the most boring thing I've tried in any game this year, so that says a lot about my opinion. The enemies were even worse than the actual mechanics.\n\nThe music was nice though, but yeah, not one of my favorite games.", "authorDisplayName": "JFK piano", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJxZ7bbl7PiIjoYv_wBUgKSuIfyZ7b_K3cYLNmgfVw=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJFGlm_edZlUY9RRuvxzlSQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCJFGlm_edZlUY9RRuvxzlSQ"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 8, "publishedAt": "2014-02-03T00:12:36Z", "updatedAt": "2014-02-03T00:12:36Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 5, "isPublic": true}, "replies": {"comments": [{"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "f2Syk5U8WVuggSddI2jT_CKU2hw", "id": "Ughxy7UDGc4DCHgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-OMqs8Y97kHhNAcQ", "snippet": {"textDisplay": "A lot of things were cut apparently.
