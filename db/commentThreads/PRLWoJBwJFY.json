It's tough to do it that way, but ya just gotta say \"alright, the game's not goin' anywhere, it'll be there when I come back.\" and do what ya need to do. MMOs have really been able to captivate me though, at least in the mind. Anyways, here's my list.\n1: I've played a number of MMOs before, such as Black Desert Online, Runescape, and Elder Scrolls Online, but my favorite one has to be Final Fantasy XIV. The world, music, everything about it is really phenomenal.\n2: My favorite kind of character to play on FFXIV is a Hyur (human) Warrior, which is a tank class. It's really the only class I know how to play effectively, and honestly, good tanks are few and far between.\n3: It's tough to choose a fondest memory, but for me, I still feel warm thinking about my first few days playing the game, starting in the city of Limsa Lominsa, doing my first few quests, and meeting someone who would eventually show me the ropes and teach me to be an effective tank.\n4: Just one franchise is another tough decision. I think the Metroid series would have a really interesting MMO, if it would ever get one. Imagine taking your pick of, say, bounty hunter, Galactic Federation, space pirate, or maybe even Chozo, having your own ship, going to different planets and space stations, that kind of stuff. One reason I choose this is because I feel there's not enough MMOs to primarily feature ranged weapons (such as guns) as forms of combat, but that might just be my inner gun nut talking.\n5: I can't really answer this one because I haven't played either, sorry!", "textOriginal": "I feel like I was of a different cut, because somehow, I can play MMOs and still not let it control my life.
