The crumbling Revachol is a demoralizing French fishing village with equally demoralizing inhabitants and happenings. Amnesia stories can rarely be described as original, but what they do with our hero to slowly uncover his past is anything but \"by the book\". I don't want to spoil anything, but the writers did an amazing job with the various dialogue choices and I couldn't count the number of times I laughed out loud or was impressed by the sheer craziness of some of the options. Kim Kitsuragi is such a good partner in this game that I always found myself trying to impress him, I wanted him to be proud of my decisions. Of course, everything is not always easy since some choices and their success can be dependant on your skills and a random dice roll. While I understand why they would do this, this randomness could often be frustating when failing something that had a 90%+ chance to succeed. I mostly refrained myself from reloading when that happened, but I simply couldn't when it had extremely impactful consequences. I'll be very honest here, this game is smarter than I am and the amount of text was simply too much (I never skipped dialogue). There's a lot of political discussion and the game tries to make you choose a side, but in the end none of that actually mattered. The overpolitical aspect was by far my biggest gripe because our hero's story and the murder mystery were what I really cared about. The good thing is that it's a very replayable game and I'll simply skip these kind of discussions. Thankfully, the back half of the game focuses mostly on that and is top notch. I smiled when the credits rolled, but the scene where this specific theme plays was one of the greatest moments of the year, and the satisfying payoff I needed.", "textOriginal": "Disco Elysium is the kind of game that sticks with you.
