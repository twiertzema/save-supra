Under shell of outdated graphics, hides a very atmospheric and interesting experience, which have been never replicated in the series since then.\u00a0\n\n\nThough, there are some problems with controls and camera, they are not as  bad, as some people say. It's gameplay take some time time to used to, but reward is a very peculiar strong experience.\nIn my personal rating I put this game above most of the post-Symphony games, including SOTN itself.
