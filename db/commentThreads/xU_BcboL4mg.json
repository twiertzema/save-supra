For someone like me who probably put thousands of hours on various Tetris versions, it makes it even easier to zone out because I don't feel like I have to put much effort to complete the stages even on Hard. I actually bought a PSVR because of this game and while I did enjoy the game with it even more, I do have to say I was not THAT impressed by its implementation. I keep reading that it's a mindblowing experience but that simply wasn't the case for me, it was enjoyable but nothing crazy either. I even thought the graphics took a huge hit inside VR with everything looking very blurry, unlike other VR games I tried. I might be the weird one here.
