As someone who grew up with the NES and played the original Legend of Zelda when I was a kid, I see this as a return to form.

Fetch quests, lots of \"do this, then that, then that, in this order, in order to go to this location\", blocking off chunks of the world until the correct item is obtained or dungeon is beaten, and dungeons that take hours to beat. \n\nTo me, Breath of the Wild is a massive breath of fresh air. I've poured over 300 hours between three save games (I'm currently on my third), and not even Skyrim (the last open world game I played before this one) did that for me. I loved exploring its world, I had a lot of fun with the new combat system, the breaking weapons actually made me really try out and appreciate the weapon variety and made finding new weapon types more special, and I loved the sheer amount of things you could do such as hijacking and riding a deer, setting things on fire, using magic (the runes) in creative ways and so much more.\n\nI do feel it has its flaws. Like balance - once you play long enough, you can become overpowered. As Supra said, the shrines and divine beasts are not separately themed. The lack of enemy variety never bothered me, but it really could use more enemy types, now that I think about it. And the density of the world itself varies - sometimes it's super dense and you find a lot of interesting things going on in a short period of time, while other times you can travel for a long time and it takes a while to find something of interest. The world should have been more dense, imo, but I dealt with it.\n\nThat said, this game brought back the feeling of exploration and danger and mystery that the very first game had in my childhood, but with many more added things on top of it, like the sheer beauty of many of the awesome looking locations - something the NES could have never pulled off.

I'm sure its a great game, but weapon durability is a big hit for me in any game. Just personal preference. And zelda music is important to me. Having the loud, iconic themes MAKE the zones I'm in is important to me.
