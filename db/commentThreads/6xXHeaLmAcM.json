This is probably my favorite SRPG in terms of what they do with your units' mobility. The variety of ways you can mix your attacks and movements is the single biggest highlight of the game and watching your unit move around, go inside a pipe, melee charge 2-3 monsters in its way, jump on a friendly character, land on a monster for more damage, hide behind cover and shoot from afar in a single movement never got tiring. I also loved how each character has unique strengths and weaknesses, even though it's too bad some of them joined too late in the game. The difficulty in the main story was well balanced, but I somehow had more trouble at the start than at the end. I'm excited for the Donkey Kong DLC and can't wait to see what's next from the team at Ubisoft.", "authorDisplayName": "SupraDarky", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 47, "publishedAt": "2018-02-26T23:20:57Z", "updatedAt": "2018-02-28T02:58:55Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 3, "isPublic": true}, "replies": {"comments": [{"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "BnhbSIh7sibI6rBJuVXyZQKWlt8", "id": "Ugz4acUujnLkNUToqy14AaABAg.8d8uWdX9lSq8dBsJEdXpKi", "snippet": {"textDisplay": "180 would definitely make more sense.", "textOriginal": "180 would definitely make more sense.", "parentId": "Ugz4acUujnLkNUToqy14AaABAg", "authorDisplayName": "SupraDarky", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 2, "publishedAt": "2018-02-28T02:59:21Z", "updatedAt": "2018-02-28T02:59:21Z"}}, {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "S_TvxIaIK38okHAgShptSpHfOHc", "id": "Ugz4acUujnLkNUToqy14AaABAg.8d8uWdX9lSq8dBQ7YTFnpg", "snippet": {"textDisplay": "SupraDarky Rayman Myths!
