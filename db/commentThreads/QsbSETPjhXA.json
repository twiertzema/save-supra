I ended up being stuck on only a few bosses, and even those it was usually 4-5 attempts. I read a lot of people saying they find Bloodborne harder than the Dark Souls series, but it was absolutely the opposite for me (and that's fine). A lot of it comes from having so many healing vials, as well as the Rally mechanic which lets you heal per hit within 5 seconds of being hit yourself. That mechanic is so great that I now wish all games in this genre had it, because it makes combat even more intense with its risk/reward.  I actually beat Gehrman on my 2nd attempt, and then proceeded to beat Moon Presence on the first try. The Orphan of Kos was definitely a big challenge though.", "textOriginal": "I played through this game for the first time this summer and... what an amazing game.
