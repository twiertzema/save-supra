The Switch release changed everything and with CrossCode set to release on Nintendo's console as well, I hope it gets the same huge boost of attention it deserves. CrossCode takes the best parts of Secret of Mana, Zelda, Lufia II and Wild Arms dungeons, then mixes that with awesome fast paced combat inside a MMORPG setting. The result is nothing short of incredible. Even outside traversal is filled with parkour puzzles to reach the various chests and it's so much fun that I wanted to get all of them (made pleasant by a chests counter in each area). The soundtrack and the pixel graphics feel simply perfect. Even the story is intriguing and full of likable characters, including great humor. Really, I have a hard time finding negatives for this one and I still think about the game which I will surely return to as they release more quests and expansions (just like a MMORPG). I don't say this easily, but to me CrossCode is nothing short of a masterpiece and just like with Hollow Knight before it, my favorite game of the year is now one of my favorites of all time.", "textOriginal": "Not only is CrossCode my favorite game of 2018, but it's not even close.
