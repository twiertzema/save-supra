Besides watching Digimon on the morning weekends on TV when I was like 6-8 years old, i've never cared too much. \nPokemon is where it's always been at.\n\n4. (I'll get to that question, but first some some story for perspective's sake) I got my first Pokemon game (Red) in 2000 when I was 5, loved it, got the sequels Gold/Silver/Crystal and Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald the years later, plus the gen 1 remakes. Loved them aswell, 3rd generation was probably the highlight given that it was the time when all my buds at school were in to Pokemon. years later, in 2007 most of them did not care anymore at all. It was just some small kids thing to them, and for a while, I agreed, mainly because the new games Diamond/Pearl had just come out. I did not have anywhere near as fun playing those games as I did with previous games in the series, so then I just thought (at 12 years of age no less!) that I had become too old for it to still be very fun. Almost 3 years later, having played next to nothing Pokemon during that time, I saw that remakes of Gold and Silver were out. After lots of consideration, I decided to try again given how much i loved my Pokemon Gold back in the day. Probably the best gaming decision I've ever made. But then I thought, what make me dislike Diamond/Pearl so much (in comparison that is)? Well, after reading about it i've seen that I was not the only one, and that most Pokemon fans think that the \"complete game\" every generation has in Platinum is far better and fixes most of the flaws of D/P, after reading that, I decided to get Platinum and WOW they were so right, so it was never about me growing too old, it was that the first games in gen 4 was really lackluster. Ok are you still reading? Good, this is where i'll start answering the question; HeartGold/SoulSilver and Platinum are easily the best games among what I like to call the 'conservative Pokemon games' after them, we got Black/White, and they were the first games that truly felt like sequels to the established formula. And it was amazing, it truly was the evolvement of the franchise that was needed. Then we got direct sequels to them, and they were still good, but did not improve at all on what made the first so great. Instead they added lots of random stuff which had nothing to do with what people like about Pokemon, and they did not make the story anywhere near as interesting as in B/W 1 which was a shame. And then a year later we got...X/Y I was really afraid that it would ignore everything that made B/W 1 so great and just go back even further than what B/W 2 did, and my fears unfortuneatly turned out to be correct. Extremely sad, what we got was another game in the 'conservative Pokemon series' with ridiculously lackluster content on top of that.\n\ntl;dr: If you've only played X/Y these last 10 years, Supra, then go back like you say you will and at least play B/W 1. They're FAR bigger improvements from the games released 10+ years ago, than what X/Y is.\n\n5. Oh and I don't think i'd like to live in a Pokemon world considering there are so many things about that world which doesn't correlate to real world logic, if I were to elaborate on that, this part would probably be longer than #4....", "textOriginal": "1.

Well, after reading about it i've seen that I was not the only one, and that most Pokemon fans think that the \"complete game\" every generation has in Platinum is far better and fixes most of the flaws of D/P, after reading that, I decided to get Platinum and WOW they were so right, so it was never about me growing too old, it was that the first games in gen 4 was really lackluster. Ok are you still reading? Good, this is where i'll start answering the question; HeartGold/SoulSilver and Platinum are easily the best games among what I like to call the 'conservative Pokemon games' after them, we got Black/White, and they were the first games that truly felt like sequels to the established formula. And it was amazing, it truly was the evolvement of the franchise that was needed. Then we got direct sequels to them, and they were still good, but did not improve at all on what made the first so great. Instead they added lots of random stuff which had nothing to do with what people like about Pokemon, and they did not make the story anywhere near as interesting as in B/W 1 which was a shame. And then a year later we got...X/Y I was really afraid that it would ignore everything that made B/W 1 so great and just go back even further than what B/W 2 did, and my fears unfortuneatly turned out to be correct. Extremely sad, what we got was another game in the 'conservative Pokemon series' with ridiculously lackluster content on top of that.\n\ntl;dr: If you've only played X/Y these last 10 years, Supra, then go back like you say you will and at least play B/W 1. They're FAR bigger improvements from the games released 10+ years ago, than what X/Y is.\n\n5. Oh and I don't think i'd like to live in a Pokemon world considering there are so many things about that world which doesn't correlate to real world logic, if I were to elaborate on that, this part would probably be longer than #4....", "authorDisplayName": "NetConsole", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJxEqszzER71UO2L_JoMhf7IaVus3ZOKWgtBAg=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYVftGfbpf1UyU5oMn130RA", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCYVftGfbpf1UyU5oMn130RA"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 4, "publishedAt": "2015-09-23T02:47:02Z", "updatedAt": "2015-09-23T02:47:02Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 1, "isPublic": true}, "replies": {"comments": [{"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "vZlnPKaqnRB_lmwlYWADy4IIuWs", "id": "UgisTJqYAXNJDngCoAEC.84QkD-uJjhO7-H3A6PMXWV", "snippet": {"textDisplay": "+NetConsole Interesting, I'm definitely intrigued to try Black/White then!", "textOriginal": "+NetConsole Interesting, I'm definitely intrigued to try Black/White then!", "parentId": "UgisTJqYAXNJDngCoAEC", "authorDisplayName": "SupraDarky", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2015-09-23T03:09:49Z", "updatedAt": "2015-09-23T03:09:49Z"}}]}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "u8ulaJtNBPuVmFDismiys7JiBhI", "id": "UggjBw9e0Rosr3gCoAEC", "snippet": {"videoId": "6b77tr2Vu9U", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "m2q2XAJsTo8uKAABPdhmr1frh24", "id": "UggjBw9e0Rosr3gCoAEC", "snippet": {"videoId": "6b77tr2Vu9U", "textDisplay": "1) Magby, Wingull, Umbreon (There's so many favorites it's hard to choose)\n2) It's either Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire or Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness (honorable to Pokemon Channel)\n3) Not very experience with the clones, but YoKai Watch or whatever it's called seems interesting.

Imaginary monster friends, haha.\n\nBy the way, if you're interested in trying spin-offs, I'd like to suggest PokePark 2 for the Wii.  It's an often looked-over spin-off, but I'd always thought the Tales series battle scheme would work well with Pokemon (four special moves, it's practically asking to be adapted), and PokePark 2 pulled it off.  I didn't see it on the list, so I wasn't sure if you'd played it, but I can definitely recommend it :)", "authorDisplayName": "terracannon876", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz58JPSonPCMdUYCBLMZJnPjZCWvH6nYP64LD-E=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9w5Q0ucUzw-UZmTGS0KZfA", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC9w5Q0ucUzw-UZmTGS0KZfA"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 1, "publishedAt": "2015-09-23T02:07:19Z", "updatedAt": "2015-09-23T02:07:19Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 3, "isPublic": true}, "replies": {"comments": [{"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "Xszz4p0QZuyexKsyMhIQ17Kd78Y", "id": "UgjLx6HIIe02kXgCoAEC.84Qff98ZzSA7-IrEzN9nWe", "snippet": {"textDisplay": "+terracannon876 You've been missing out then !
