I would have a hard time recommending this game if you're a strictly solo player. A lot of bosses can be very frustrating, especially because they tend to rely on spamming additional enemies which I always found to be bad design. And you can add to that the fact that the \"health potions\" in this game take way too long to use because of the animation. It's a strange game really, but still one I would recommend to people who enjoy co-op looter shooters with Souls elements.
