This would absolutely have made my Top 10 of its year of release. It manages to mix various gameplay styles and have tons of references to classic games without feeling too gimmicky or cringy. The main gameplay is Zelda inspired, but everything it does, it does well. It's super impressive and it's also a meaty game. The soundtrack is really good as well, with this theme playing during the addictive card mini-game.", "textOriginal": "The first game was a flawed but enjoyable prototype, and even if I knew this sequel would build on it, I wasn't prepared to love it so much.
