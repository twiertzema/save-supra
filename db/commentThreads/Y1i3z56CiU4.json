There was only one new poison type?\n\n-The battles are slower than they should be, which adds up if you battle often.\n\n-The character customization is worse and more generic than the first Sims.\n\n-The battle music itself is mind-numbingly repetitive and only changes on special occasions.\n\n-Every Pokemon is not readily available through these two games, and some of them are only available through the friend safari, which is just the developers way of involving people you meet on your DS.\n\n-The story and plot layout has not changed much at all. You still go through the same process, to go to the same place. It is like they made this game so similar to the first generation on purpose, just so Nintendo fans can remain in their nostalgic bubble.\n\n-While I appreciate the Pokemon being represented in 3D models and having unique animations (which turned out pretty damn awesome), I don't understand why they did not innovate just as much to the entire game itself.", "authorDisplayName": "Obby", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJyumeB3xSLXXTC9wlvHOfAyBowM_FjiQ3QxzZPUbQ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB4qx6aknMONopsjwL6W38Q", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCB4qx6aknMONopsjwL6W38Q"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2014-02-16T07:38:52Z", "updatedAt": "2014-02-16T07:38:52Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 1, "isPublic": true}, "replies": {"comments": [{"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "_xhBqQ_f0o498OE2ZlcxJCeWqXw", "id": "Ugjfii1-iOMpsHgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-QXx77-HKOQ9R5GT", "snippet": {"textDisplay": "- I believe that to be a deliberate choice by Nintendo and GameFreak. \u00a0Not to say that you're wrong to be concerned about it, but I've felt for the longest time that they wanted this kind of data to be discovered, rather than simply displayed. \u00a0That being said, even with Super Training (and by extension, Super Training's cutting of the original max 255 EV limit to 252 for the sake of convenience), that kind of info should at least be somehow indicated more clearly in-game, so we wouldn't need someone to pick the system apart and have to make a calculator for all the guess work.\n\n- You stated that the issue was that you have to pick certain Mega Evolutions to be competitive. \u00a0I feel that the real issue is that you have to have one at all. \u00a0Even though Mega Evolutions add quite an interesting mechanic to the game, seeing as only a handful of Pokemon can use it, my concern even when they went through the details was that team comps would be based around said Mega Evolution, rather than being solely a preference.\n\n- I can't really comment on slower battles, as I haven't really noticed.\n\n- I find this to be fair enough, considering everything else that makes these versions different from Gen 5, and the fact that it's on the 3DS. \u00a0One would assume that the next generation (because we all know there will be one) will expand on the customization features. \u00a0I would hope so, as the only gripe my friend and I have is that we can't actually remove our hats.\n\n- The music was pretty hit-or-miss overall. \u00a0Props to the devs for trying to mix it up a bit, though. \u00a0That being said, I have to wonder why they removed the popular critical-hp track.\n\n- I don't entirely see anything wrong with this, as that has always been their intent. \u00a0Even in Gen 1, there were Pokemon that were on one version but not the other, encouraging you to trade with others. \u00a0But on the note of Pokemon availability, I have to say that I'm somewhat disappointed with Pokemon Bank/Transporter, seeing as the interface requires the D-Pad instead of the stylus (lolwut), and the BIGGEST issue of having to go through asinine hoops just to transfer from previous generations.\n\n- It's pretty much a given at this point. \u00a0It's hard to decide whether Nintendo is either playing it safe, or just being...Nintendo.\n\n- I can't comment on innovation because I'm not sure what you mean by it. \u00a0How do you feel they could innovate the current formula, as far as the 3D models go?
