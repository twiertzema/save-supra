I finished it one ~3 hours sitting, I couldn't put it down. It ticks all the boxes of a game that makes me finish it to completion, without a single thing left to do. You're a little bird who just wants to hike up the mountain in the middle of the island and as you progress, you encounter other hikers that often have side missions for you. You can also find feathers hidden around the island that allow you to fly higher/longer. The gameplay just feels perfect, the pixelated 3D graphics are vibrant and the music is charming. The whole game oozes charm and I couldn't stop smiling. Pure pleasure mixed with some Animal Crossing vibes. I cannot recommend it enough. A Short Hike is one of the best short games I've ever played.", "textOriginal": "This game is a delight. I finished it one ~3 hours sitting, I couldn't put it down.
