I would start a new playlist every few months (in a non-methodical order), which means I associate different lists with different points in time. \n\nAnd songs on this list have introduced me to full soundtracks I love like Shatter, Neotokyo, Silent Hill, Wangan Midnight, Umineko, Unreal Tournament to name a few.

The list seemed huge at the time, but it\u2019s now double that.\n\nUp to 2012, I only listened to soundtracks of games I knew already - Mario and Sonic especially, and Super Smash Bros Brawl. I was subscribed to SD that year because I found some Mario tracks I knew on there, which is arguably missing the point of the channel. I can't remember why I clicked on it, possibly because I found a lot of time on my hands that summer, but Parabolic Hyperflies blew my mind. I hadn't realised I could appreciate game music without knowing the game behind it. But in fact, the unfamiliar games would be the ones I would most appreciate. \n\n1176-1199 became the first snippet of SD which I listened to on repeat, followed by the rest of playlist 6 just as I went to university. The duration of the playlist is only a few hours, but the density of good songs is so high (as with all these playlists) that I could savour it over months.\n \nWhen I left my room, the music would often stick in my head for the day, or multiple days. I keep a note of the songs which stick the most - these aren\u2019t really game songs to me, but a kind of soundtrack to my life. I would start a new playlist every few months (in a non-methodical order), which means I associate different lists with different points in time. \n\nAnd songs on this list have introduced me to full soundtracks I love like Shatter, Neotokyo, Silent Hill, Wangan Midnight, Umineko, Unreal Tournament to name a few.
