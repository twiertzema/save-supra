Sure, it doesn't always feel fair when you're suddenly randomly targetted by 5+ players and you go to from a clean board to a catastrophy in a matter of seconds, but the adrenaline rush is amazing. Reaching the top 10 is hard enough, but with the music kicking in you start getting in a zone that feels perfect. I really like the additions of various boards because I was definitely getting tired of the same theme playing all the time.
