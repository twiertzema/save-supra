I was particularly impressed this year with Nintendo and Ubisoft (Mario + Rabbids, BGE2 and other solid entries in established series). Microsoft's conference bored me and Sony's simply felt unnecessary, and it made me actually appreciate Nintendo's quick, direct format. Needless to say that Mario Odyssey looked amazing and with Xenoblade 2 also coming out, it feels unreal that we will get these games in 2017 after we already got a Zelda masterpiece. The nicest surprise had to be Metroid Prime 4 being in development (not by Retro!). There's Samus Returns for 3DS as well, though I'm cautiously optimistic seeing as Mercury Steam can bring awesome games like Lords of Shadow, but also mediocre ones like Mirror of Fate and LoS2.
