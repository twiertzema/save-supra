The game's atmosphere is really unique, with great landscapes and sceneries never seen before in any metroid game. \n\nDespite all that, I would like to point out some of the minor issues/complaints/details that I would suggest to the developer/producer (docm64) to take into consideration if he decides to update the game.... \n\n1- when you run out of power bombs, the enemies won't give you items to replenish it, you had to go back to a save station to replenish them, which made it a bit annoying, specially when you were next or close to an expansion and you had no power bombs left.\n2- The hit box on Omega metroids is ridiculously big and the final boss was easy, too easy in my opinion.. \n3- the death animation on the bigger metroids were a bit anti-climatic, specially the queen \n4- saves stations were kind of far away from some bosses, so you had to play a while whilst heading back again to fight the monster, \n5- Even though I think missiles are VERY important because that is how you kill the metroids and that is how you progress through the game, I think there were too many easy expansions at the start of the game. I had been playing the game for 20 or 30mins and I already had like 100 missiles. If the game is going to give us that much, it would have been better to scatter them around and hide them even more, and therefore make us look for them in a more detailed manner \n6- It would have been great for the queen to summon larval metroids instead of those brown thingies she spits, \n7- Some of the theme transitions weren't that spot on. I remember heading down into the lava area where you encounter the first omega metroid (right before the nest), the music was the same upbeat theme from the previous sector. I mean, you need to build the tension. The only way to do that is with a more frightening and menacing theme, which wasn't the case.\n\nWhat do you think about that?
