As for the combat, I felt way more involved than the first game but the low enemy variety was a disappointment. This is a beautiful game, but it unfortunately kept the original's biggest flaw that I had mentioned back then: the difficulty in terms of platforming and combat is quickly rendered superficial by being able to brute force everything. The sense of accomplishment after traversing a room full of (low-damaging) spikes despite failing the intended platforming always felt like I had cheated the game, and it's the same thing with the bosses I would end up tanking. Really, the best fight in the whole game is the first boss against the giant beetle because you have a low amount of health and skills at your disposal, which makes you learn its pattern. This seems mostly negative, but I'd say it's more about being frustrated that Moon Studios did not learn much from the first game. I loved the game, probably more than the first, but it could have been even better with a few simple changes.
