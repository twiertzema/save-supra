Kratos was actually likable as a character and his interactions with his son were very interesting. The graphics are top notch, presenting some surprisingly colorful and high contrast environments. The combat system is also very fun, especially with the axe, but it's unfortunate that the variety of monsters is so low for such a big budgeted title. I also thought there should have been more epic boss battles that the series is known for. This is also one of the biggest cases of ludonarrative dissonance you will ever see, but it hardly matters. Apart from that, the exploration with its side quests was truly awesome and I actually 100% the game, which is always a great sign. In a way, God of War 2018's structure gave me vibes of Zelda, but more precisely of the first Darksiders.
