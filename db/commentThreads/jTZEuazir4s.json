This is the worthy Super Metroid \"clone\" I've been waiting for all these years. I have a very small list of games I can play through almost annually and SM was the only of one its genre... but no more, ESA has entered that list. I played so many Metroid clones and while they're almost always very solid, I'd always leave thinking that some magic ingredients (that honestly I'm not sure I can even properly identify) were missing. ESA completely came out of left field for me, I discovered it during Steam's Winter sale. The graphics first seem very basic, but they're actually full of details and help make the various areas stand out from each other. The game has flavor. It feels like each pixel has been manually added and it ends up having way more personality than the clean-looking Axiom Verge. No boring corridors, the variety of room designs is perfectly balanced. Some of the areas even feel dynamic as they change through the adventure. The great soundtrack also adds to the awesome atmosphere. This is the first 2D action exploration game since Super Metroid that managed to give me that awesome feeling of entering a new area, glancing at its unique setting while the theme kicks in and think \"I wonder what I'll be in for, I can't wait to explore\". The gameplay is top notch (double jump, awesome grappling hook, dashes and more), you always feel in control of your character. The upgrades are significant and change the way you explore the world in a great way, though one optional upgrade you can get near the end is overpowered. The weapon variety is minimal, but it never bothered me. There are a lot of bosses and they're all very solidly designed. After you beat the game, there are even cryptic puzzles that you can try to decipher for a secret ending (we're talking Fez type of cryptic here, I had to use the internet but it's definitely doable), adding many hours of gameplay. I played on both difficulties and I have to say, I found the Easy difficulty to be the perfect one for a first playthrough, I highly recommend doing that (especially because of the bosses). All the faults I talked about in Axiom Verge are nowhere to be found here. This is my 2nd favorite 2D action exploration game of all time, behind Super Metroid. Oh, and I'm such a big fan of the game's world structure that I added a link to the detailed map in the description which you can zoom (do not open if you don't want to be spoiled).
