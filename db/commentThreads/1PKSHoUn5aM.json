Then came The Amber Throne which looked really intriguing with its pastel graphics and very positive reviews. I played through it before going on vacation and what a great surprise this was. The hand drawn graphics are amazing, be it when walking around or the enemy design in battles. The huge soundtrack is equally impressive and helps define the game; it has a very rhythmic, native and eclectic feel to it. Jasmine Cooper is obviously very talented, just hearing the part at 1:30 in this village theme early on in the game made me realize it was something special. And you know what? The story and the characters are also very solid and kept me interested the whole way through, ending with a satisfying climax. Really, this is a very solid and unique RPG that will stick with you.", "textOriginal": "A lot of the RPGMaker games I bought and played on Steam were so bad or average that it turned me off from buying more of them.
