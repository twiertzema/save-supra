You really feel like you're watching a storybook adventure unfold before your eyes, cheerleading the mouse Quill through the various puzzles and encounters. The interaction with Quill and the world itself are easily the highlights, to the point where I would keep stopping and just enjoy the scenery around me. An encounter with deers (huge compared to Quill and her grass-sized world) peacefully drinking water in the background almost felt emotional, I was simply in the moment and the fantasy, almost Jeremy Soule-like, music was perfect. These are the kind of moments where you wonder what the future of VR will be like if it's already this effective. The whole game is quite simple with a few surprising puzzles but also quite short, or else this would have made my Top 10. I'm excited for Book II.", "textOriginal": "VR can be an absolutely magical experience and a game like Moss showcases it in such a pleasant way.
