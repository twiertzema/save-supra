The two gun system\u00a0was also new (not saying it was the first game to use it as I'm not sure but it popularized it) and added a little strategy to how you were going to play. Vehicles to traverse large open areas. Single player co-op. An interesting alien setting and wonderful ending. The other entries would add their own important pieces to the franchise (Halo 2 defined Xbox Live and made matchmaking a thing, Halo 3 allowed for lots of customization in the multiplayer like never before). The single player campaigns for 1, 3, and\u00a0ODST\u00a0are top notch to me. 2 and Reach falling a bit behind though still worth a play through.\u00a0The story to me never really meant much to me post Halo 2 though apparently it makes more sense if you've read books\u00a0though I find that to not be a good execution for us who only care to play the games. So really aside from storytelling the Bungie developed Halo games were\u00a0great and I argue that they still hold up today in terms of actual gameplay.\u00a0", "parentId": "UggJG2sUr6rgH3gCoAEC", "authorDisplayName": "boyblob", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJwKAckB7G6ALBCtWecMNM-KIT3pshPF2HVoke1v=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfEjfPJ-Nhs5LJ8C23fvEpw", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCfEjfPJ-Nhs5LJ8C23fvEpw"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2015-01-21T12:23:59Z", "updatedAt": "2015-01-21T12:23:59Z"}}, {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "_2xKrtxCGEewXtvId5aNFd9-XE4", "id": "UggJG2sUr6rgH3gCoAEC.7-H0Z7-GW-x7-HfC3aSG--", "snippet": {"textDisplay": "Going to chime in on this and say that I think the original Halo trilogy are three of the best games ever made. \u00a0Very solid gameplay combined with a really cool setting, and excellent music. \u00a0You could argue that it has cheesy presentation, but I think it was intentionally so, and I think they did a really great job with it (Halo 3 had some pretty bad lines). \u00a0Series is dead to me since 343 took over though.", "textOriginal": "Going to chime in on this and say that I think the original Halo trilogy are three of the best games ever made. \u00a0Very solid gameplay combined with a really cool setting, and excellent music. \u00a0You could argue that it has cheesy presentation, but I think it was intentionally so, and I think they did a really great job with it (Halo 3 had some pretty bad lines). \u00a0Series is dead to me since 343 took over though.", "parentId": "UggJG2sUr6rgH3gCoAEC", "authorDisplayName": "ZeClooman", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJwLEgB-4QgOZJIWiOd_lNXBcbGm-9KsLp4ZtPWC=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw9bmMPzYXhvPU9BQLs1HTA", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCw9bmMPzYXhvPU9BQLs1HTA"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 1, "publishedAt": "2015-01-21T08:34:59Z", "updatedAt": "2015-01-21T08:34:59Z"}}, {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "gWGtJ4X32rnxOhouy2rLdsAqAHk", "id": "UggJG2sUr6rgH3gCoAEC.7-H0Z7-GW-x7-HTA1Towye", "snippet": {"textDisplay": "I was an insanely huge halo fan, it was a very big part of my childhood.
