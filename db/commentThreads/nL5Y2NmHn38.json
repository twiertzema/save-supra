There's a huge amount of buildings and sites you can visit, but a lot of them are way too similar, so I found the exterior world much more interesting. The inventory system is a disaster to go through and choosing the right equipment is made tedious by the lack of comparison stats with your currently equipped stuff. The lack of polish is almost expected with Bethesda, but the fact that Fallout 4 played it so safe in other departments means that they should have been able to spend extra time on polish.
