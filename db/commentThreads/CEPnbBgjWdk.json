While I was mostly disappointed with Gone Home and The Stanley Parable, I did end up enjoying Brothers. I didn't really get any of the emotional connection some people had with the story as I thought it sometimes felt forced, and I feel like the puzzles often showed potential but were never too developed. What is it that won me over? The atmosphere and the amazingly varied vistas, giving you a great feel of being on a big adventure even if it only truly spans a couple a hours. The whole game had a mix of ICO and Fable auras.\n\nOne thing to note, I played this game on PC and found it almost unplayable with a keyboard. Decided to use my generic USB controller, and one of the very first puzzles is bugged unless you have the Xbox 360 controller for PC, so I had to buy one (good investment for other games so I wasn't too unhappy). Still, quite a mishap on the developers' part.", "authorDisplayName": "SupraDarky", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 21, "publishedAt": "2014-01-26T23:24:44Z", "updatedAt": "2014-01-26T23:24:44Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 2, "isPublic": true}, "replies": {"comments": [{"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "JkBQOV2alTQGNC3qeItwW1r4NcE", "id": "UggSsImZUdedpngCoAEC.7-H0Z7-L7i47Jrq4FWmVcb", "snippet": {"textDisplay": "@SupraDarky This sums up my experience with the game pretty perfectly.
