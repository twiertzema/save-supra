The mix of an openworld-style hub using PS1 graphics with 2D dungeons definitely ticks nostalgia boxes, and I was very surprised to see such variety in gameplay/atmosphere between the different dungeons as you progress. Some dungeons even change the graphics style! It's all helped by an equally dreamy soundtrack. I do have to say that in terms of writing, I sometimes felt like I had to be inside the writer's brain to fully understand everything. Maybe I'm just not smart enough, I understood the overall story and where it was going but often found myself scratching my head at some of the things I was reading.
